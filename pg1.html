            <h3 class="card-text">I wore the flannel that you gave me. There was a small tent. There were fairly lights. There was our favorite show on the laptop. There were fries and coke, and YOU! Looking so good in that cute white dress which
              makes
              my heart skip a beat every time I see you in it. It was the perfect first date. we were still in that almost girlfriend-boyfriend phase and we officially ended it. I gave you a handwritten letter with bad English and grammar and you
              gave me a rose and a note which said: "Will you be my boyfriend". This made our first date complete. And of course, the sexy times, in the end, made it even better. Thank you. I can't imagine a better first date.</h3>
